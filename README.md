# y1_notebook
Setup for bayesfast notebook

Instructions:

1. Install cosmosis using "bash cosmosis_install.sh" (unless you have it installed somewhere already) 

2. Run "bash y1_notebook_setup.sh" (once only please or lines will be duplicated in the setup files) 

3. Open the notebook (./bayesfast/examples/edited-y1-notebook.ipynb) from JupyterHub and select Cosmosis-nb-y1 from the dropdown menu

--
If you already have cosmosis installed somewhere, ignore step 1 and source setup-cosmosis-nersc as you usually would, removing the first line of the y1_notebook_setup script
